Mapping Temperature Flow Using Raspberry Pi

Student Name: Ian Hutchinson						Student ID: 200*****
Introduction
The idea behind this project is to attempt to build a prototype IoT device that will use a Raspberry Pi as a smart environment monitoring device. I aim to use inexpensive electrical components widely available and deploy several standalone sensors throughout building to gather data that is sufficient to accurately map temperature differences between different areas. Data from each temperature sensor could possibly be published to a cloud MQTT broker or similar IoT platform such as ThingSpeak. Depending on the area being monitored, the network must be flexible in terms of adding or removing sensors to accommodate different monitoring requirements.

Tools, Technology and Equipment
Having a little experience in electrical technology, I aim to build smart sensors using the following components:
•	Hand Tools
•	Solderless breadboards
•	Jumper wires
•	Raspberry Pi 	•	ESP8266 Wifi modules
•	ds18b20 or TMP36 Temp Sensors
•	Resistors
•	AA battery holder

As of writing, implementation is still in the planning phase. Communication protocols covered in the module from data link layer to application will be implemented.
